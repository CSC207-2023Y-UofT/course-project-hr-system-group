# How to Run the Program

Since this feature is only the "Schedule" portion of the overall HR Management System, there are some dependencies on classes that are present throughout the entire system.
There have been stand-in classes ("Employee" and "HRSystem") made to test this portion somewhat independently, as well as a "Main" class that can be run to simulate an active HR System that would open the Schedule interface.

A sample set of Employees has been hard-coded into the "Main" class in the "drivers" package, as well as a pre-set .csv file that matches the data.
Run said class to test the scheduling feature.
